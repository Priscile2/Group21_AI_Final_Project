# Predicting and Nurturing Entrepreneurs

This repository houses the project undertaken by Priscile Nkenmeza Nzonbi and Jackline Mpaye.

## Summary
This project aims to predict the entrepreneurial competence of Ashesi students and provide personalized support for their success as entrepreneurs. 

## Objectives

1. Develop a machine learning model for predicting entrepreneurial competence.
2. Collect and preprocess a dataset of student skills and experiences.
3. Implement feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy.
4. Train and fine-tune a deep learning model for predicting the entrepreneurial competence.

## How to run our Model

1. Install various models, (pickle, tensorflow, streamlit,...)
2. Download the files into the same folder
3. Run the command 'streamlit run app.py' in your terminal
4. Perform the rating on various features
5. Click the predict bottom

## Limitations
Prediction accuracy depends on data quality. The model is a guide, not an absolute determinant.
